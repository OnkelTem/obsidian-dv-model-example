# Turkish Language Learning Board

One of the distinctive characteristics of the Turkish language is extensive [agglutination](https://www.turkishtextbook.com/adding-word-endings-agglutination/).
This means that words are compound words, they're made up of a root (stem) and multiple endings.

So learning Turkish is very much about learning those compound words and the ways they're built.

Each such word or phrase may have a story, a definition, a set of examples, and forward and backward links. And it's also an entry in the vocabulary you're creating.

There are two types of vocabulary entries: `suffix` and `word`.

So you will be adding texts in Turkish, and linking phrases, words, and suffixes of your interest to special `word` and `suffix` notes, building up your personal "investigation board", and in fact - a hypertext vocabulary.
